# Interactive-Text-Summarization-Application-with-Hugging-Face-and-Streamit

1) Developed a Streamlit application for AI- powered text summarization using Hugging Face's Falcon-7B model.
2) Implemented text splitting functionality to process large texts efficiently.
3) Configured model parameters for text summarization to optimize performance.
4) Enhanced user interaction with real-time feedback and intuitive UI using Streamlit framework.

Features:

Text Summarization: Uses the Falcon-7B model from Hugging Face to generate concise and accurate summaries of input text.
Large Text Handling: Implements text splitting functionality to process lengthy documents or articles in smaller chunks, ensuring efficient and error-free summarization.
Optimized Performance: Configures model parameters and optimization techniques to enhance summarization speed and quality.
Real-time Feedback: Interactive UI built with Streamlit for real-time feedback on text input, enabling users to see the summary instantly as they interact with the application.
Intuitive User Interface: Clean and user-friendly interface designed with Streamlit, allowing users to input text, adjust settings, and view summaries with minimal effort.

Technologies Used:

Hugging Face Transformers: For implementing the Falcon-7B model for text summarization.
Streamlit: For creating the interactive, real-time front-end user interface.
Python: Main programming language used to tie everything together.

How to Run:

Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py.
Input your text and get a summary in real-time!

Future Improvements:
